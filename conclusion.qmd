# Conclusion

We realize for some of the research questions, it's hard to visualize. Consequently, we choose to answer three research questions among all ten listed in introduction that are essential and can be visualized with tools learnt in class. 

Firstly, among the 30 abilities with top frequencies, the four abilities "omniknight_hammer_of_purity", "death_prophet_exorcism", "lina_fiery_soul", and "tusk_snowball" have the highest damage, kills, gold, experiences points earned, and kda (a statistic that is used to measure a player's performance), and are therefore the most valuable based on our analysis. Secondly, for these four abilities selected, they function better on radient instead of dire. Thirdly, each ability is tied to different heroes. Heroes Dawnbreaker, Grimstroke, Legion Commander, and Rubrick tend to be hgh associated with the ability "death_prophet_exorcism"; the hero Lina is highest correlated to the ability "lina_fiery_soul"; heroes Omniknight and Tiny is highest correlated to the ability "omniknight_hammer_of_purity"; heroes Tusk and Templar Assassin is highest correlated to the ability "tusk_snowball". Thus, when we want to select four abilities in the game mode, we need to notice the compatibility between the assigned hero and the abilities. Fourthly, we examine the economic standing of the player possessing these four abilities compared to other abilities, and we conclude that all four of them are under reasonably fine economic standing, with "death_prophet_exorcism" having extremely high net worth compared to all abilities, confirming their overall value. 

The most essential limitation in our research is that, in theory, there is a total of over 500 abilities that need to be analyzed. However, it's hard to visualize such large set of abilities, and also many abilities have very limited amount of data, so we decide to only do research on the abilities with top frequencies in our dataset. It's possible that abilities other than these 30 abilities selected to be more valuable. Thus, in the future, it's better to collect more data to gain more information regarding all abilities, and we also need to figure out better ways to visualize such large dataset so that our conclusion would be more comprehensive.

During our research process, we learnt the importance of data preprocessing before start graphing. For example,at the beginning, the abilities are arrays with four integers in each, and we realize it's hard to draw any graphs by using such dataset. Then, we need to go back and converted them back to ability names and separate each row into four rows. This process should be better done before starting data visualization.
