# Conclusion

We have decided to focus on addressing four essential research questions from the initial list of ten introduced in the study. This decision stems from the recognition that certain research questions, due to their complexity, are challenging to visualize effectively. Our strategy is to prioritize those questions that are crucial and can be well-represented using the tools we've learned in class.

In our research, we have derived five key conclusions. Firstly, within the subset of the top 10 abilities identified through win rate analysis, namely "omniknight_martyr," "winter_wyvern_arctic_burn," "slark_shadow_dance," and "necrolyte_reapers_scythe," we observed that these abilities exhibit the highest metrics in terms of kills, gold acquisition, experience points, and overall kda.

Secondly, among these four selected abilities, we noted a preference for the radiant side over the dire side, indicating a distinct functionality advantage on the radiant team.

Thirdly, each ability is intricately linked to different heroes. For instance, the ability "necrolyte_reapers_scythe" is closely associated with heroes like Lifestealer and Necrophos. This underscores the importance of considering hero-ability compatibility when selecting abilities in the game.

Fourthly, our investigation extended to the resources consumed by players possessing these four abilities in comparison to others. We found that some of these abilities incur higher costs, demanding player attention to resource management.

Lastly, we introduced a method for selecting between two popular abilities in Dota 2, distinct from the ones previously analyzed. Our conclusion indicates that "shadow_dance" stands out as a significantly superior choice when compared to the alternative ability.

A central limitation of our research comes from the expansive dataset, which encompasses over 500 abilities requiring analysis. The enormity of this dataset poses challenges in visualization, particularly as numerous abilities have limited available data. Consequently, we have opted to narrow our focus to abilities with higher win rates. It's important to recognize that alternative methodologies exist for identifying the best abilities, and there is a potential that abilities beyond the current selection may hold greater value. To address this, future research efforts should consider collecting more comprehensive data on all abilities. Additionally, exploring more effective visualization techniques for managing extensive datasets would bolster the persuasiveness of our conclusions.

Through our research journey, we gained valuable insights into the significance of data preprocessing before delving into the graphing phase. At the outset, our dataset represented abilities as arrays, each containing four integers. Recognizing the challenge in creating meaningful visualizations with such a format, we undertook the crucial step of reverting these arrays back to their original ability names. In order to facilitate effective data visualization, we further refined our approach by breaking down each row into four distinct rows. This preprocessing step proved essential in preparing the data for graphical representation. It underscored the importance of thoughtful data organization and structure before beginning the visualization phase of our research.
