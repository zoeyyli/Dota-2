# Introduction

We chose a final project analyzing the value of abilities in Dota 2’s “Ability Draft” (AD) game mode. Every drafting phase begins by randomly selecting 12 out of the 124 characters or “heroes” in Dota 2. Each hero has four unique abilities associated with them, [QA, WA, EA, RA] for a generic hero A. Of the 12 selected heroes, one is assigned to each of the 10 players, although the abilities of the unused heroes remain in the drafting pool. Then, in drafting order, each player selects one of the abilities in the pool to assign to their hero. Once all players have four abilities, the drafting phase ends and the players face-off in a five versus five Dota 2 match. 

Gold and experience are finite resources in Dota 2 that must be divided amongst teammates. In practice, it is better for some players to receive the majority of the resources because different abilities/heroes require various resources to be maximally effective. In AD, these resources must be intuitively divided by the players on the same team to reach maximum effectiveness. 

Using the data provided by OPENDOTA, we can analyze the value of each of the abilities in a pool. For example, we could derive the win-rate associated with each ability from the results of a sample of matches. However, this only scratches the surface. There are approximately 16 quadrillion possible drafts, and 500 million ways to order the heroes in each draft. An ability’s value varies from draft to draft in a way that win-rate fails to capture. 

In the data, we will have access to metrics like gold earned, experience earned, damage dealt, damage received, damage reduced, kills/death/assists in match, player rating, and much more. We could analyze how much an ability impacts a player’s survivability, damage, or wealth. Or we could discover which abilities perform well without gold, what two abilities have the highest average damage, and which ability is the most over-valued in the drafting phase.
